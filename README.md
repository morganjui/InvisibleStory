InvisibleStory

This project is building up a prototype of an interactive story book accomplished by infrared LEDs, receivers and Arduino boards. IR LEDs are installed in each page of the story book with different signal encoded. A hand held device with a IR Receiver is used to detect the signals and transmit the signal to the computer to play related soundtracks.
